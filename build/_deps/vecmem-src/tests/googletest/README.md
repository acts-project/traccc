# GoogleTest Build Instructions

This subdirectory holds instructions for building
[GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) as part of this project.
This is meant to come in handy for building the project's tests in environments
which do not provide GoogleTest themselves.

Note that since GoogleTest is only needed for the unit tests of this project,
which are not installed together with the project, GoogleTest is not installed
together with the project either.
