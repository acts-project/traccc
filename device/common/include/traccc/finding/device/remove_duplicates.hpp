/**
 * @brief The CKF duplicate removal kernel.
 *
 * This kernel is designed to remove duplicate tracks from the CKF algorithm.
 * As a motivating example, consider a truth track consisting of spacepoints
 * A, B, C, D, and E. During seed finding, we find seeds 1: (A, B, C) and
 * 2: (A, B, D). Although the seeds are different, they will eventually end up
 * with exactly the same spacepoints, and thus one of them can be removed.
 *
 * This kernel detects tracks with the same spacepoints and keeps only the one
 * with the lowest $\chi^2$ score.
 *
 * @note For performance reasons, this kernel can only deduplicate tracks with
 * the last measurement the same. Thus, while a track (A, B, C, D) might be
 * able to replace a shorter track (A, B, C), this algorithm will not do so.
 * This is not a large problem, however, as tracks with a different initial
 * spacepoint are much more likely to have significantly different initial
 * track parameters.
 *
 * @warning If this kernel is run very early in the CKF process, it might end
 * up removing tracks that are the same before they begin the branch. The very
 * minimum length at which tracks can be removed is 3 spacepoints, but the
 * minimum length should be configured conform physics performance
 * requirements. Intuitively, longer tracks with the same spacepoints have
 * undergone more Kálmán gain to bring them closer together, and thus it is
 * increasingly less likely that they will diverge afterwards.
