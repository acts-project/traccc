/// This class can be used to select CUDA devices in a modern C++ way, with
/// scope safety. When an object of this class is constructed, it will switch
/// the thread-local device selector to the device number specified in the
/// constructor argument. When this object goes out of scope or gets
/// destructed in any other way, it will restore the device that was set
/// before the object was constructed. This allows us to easily write methods
/// with few side-effects.
///
/// @warning The behaviour of this class is not well-defined if you construct
/// more than one in the same scope.
