/**
 * @brief A fast and GPU-friendly map for consecutive module IDs to values.
 *
 * Using std::map to model the relationship between geometry identifiers and
 * transformation matrices works only on the CPU. std::map is not supported at
 * all on CUDA, and either doesn't work or is inefficient on other platforms.
 *
 * This class is a more efficient and more GPU-friendly implementation of the
 * geometry ID to transformation mapping concept.
 *
 * The implementation of this class relies on the idea that module IDs exist in
 * contiguous sub-ranges, and we use this fact to get more efficient accesses.
 * First, we reduce the range of module IDs to a set of contiguous sub-ranges.
 * In the TrackML detector, there are roughly 18,000 modules, but there are
 * only 71 contiguous sub-arrays. Because we can index a contiguous range in
 * constant time, this presents possible speed-up.
 *
 * Thus, the map is essentially two-layered. First, we determine which
 * contigous sub-range a given value must fall in, and then we get the value
 * from that sub-range in constant time.
 *
 * The first layer is implemented as a simple balanced binary search tree,
 * which we implement in a GPU-friendly fashion. This means that the cost of
 * finding the relevant sub-range is O(log_2(n)), with n the number of
 * sub-ranges. For the TrackML detector, this means we can find our value in
 * only 7 steps!
 *
 * @note In theory, this class can be used for any mapping of key to value, but
 * it relies quite heavily (for performance) on the contiguous nature of the
 * keys inserted into it.
 *
 * @note This map supports only construction. You can't update it in any way.
 * To build one, construct a std::map first, and then convert it.
